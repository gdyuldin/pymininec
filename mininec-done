                 The flag is set to 0 on change of frequency, change
                 of loads, or change of wires.
                 if FLG is 1, only right hand sides are computed, if FLG
                 is 2 nothing is recomputed (jumps directly to printing

Looks like the PSI computation has three entry points:
87  used for impedance matrix calculation
102 in image loop
54  used in near field calculation
    after setup of (X1, Y1, Z1), (X2, Y2, Z2), (V1, V2, V3) this jumps
    into the middle of the psi calculation in 135

The PSI computation uses the INTEGRALS I2 & I3 as a subroutine

CI(50)      Current, Right hand side of equation (imag)
CR(50)      Current, Right hand side of equation (real)

W%(50)      Currently Mininec.w_per
ZR(50,50)   Z, real part
ZI(50,50)   Z, imag part

NS: Number of sources (must be below MP)

These are dimensioned to MW+MP=100
-> Not really it's 2*MW: This stores all the start positions in the
   first half and the end positions in the second half during init
-> Hmm and during computation is uses this for pulse data, then it
   should be sized with MP. Yech.
E(100) Index of pulse indexed by source (1..NS) index ("Excitation")
L(100) Complex voltage on pulse, real part
M(100) Complex voltage on pulse, imag part

Not used when computing connections, looks like the variables are
repurposed there.
